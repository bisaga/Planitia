            "description": "\n\n`iron-list` displays a virtual, 'infinite' list. The template inside\nthe iron-list element represents the DOM to create for each list item.\nThe `items` property specifies an array of list item data.\n\nFor performance reasons, not every item in the list is rendered at once;\ninstead a small subset of actual template elements *(enough to fill the viewport)*\nare rendered and reused as the user scrolls. As such, it is important that all\nstate of the list template be bound to the model driving it, since the view may\nbe reused with a new model at any time. Particularly, any state that may change\nas the result of a user interaction with the list item must be bound to the model\nto avoid view state inconsistency.\n\n__Important:__ `iron-list` must either be explicitly sized, or delegate scrolling to an\nexplicitly sized parent. By \"explicitly sized\", we mean it either has an explicit\nCSS `height` property set via a class or inline style, or else is sized by other\nlayout means (e.g. the `flex` or `fit` classes).\n\n### Template model\n\nList item templates should bind to template models of the following structure:\n\n```js\n{\n  index: 0,        \/\/ index in the item array\n  selected: false, \/\/ true if the current item is selected\n  tabIndex: -1,    \/\/ a dynamically generated tabIndex for focus management\n  item: {}         \/\/ user data corresponding to items[index]\n}\n```\n\nAlternatively, you can change the property name used as data index by changing the\n`indexAs` property. The `as` property defines the name of the variable to add to the binding\nscope for the array.\n\nFor example, given the following `data` array:\n\n##### data.json\n\n```js\n[\n  {\"name\": \"Bob\"},\n  {\"name\": \"Tim\"},\n  {\"name\": \"Mike\"}\n]\n```\n\nThe following code would render the list (note the name and checked properties are\nbound from the model object provided to the template scope):\n\n```html\n&lt;template is=\"dom-bind\"&gt;\n  &lt;iron-ajax url=\"data.json\" last-response=\"{{data}}\" auto&gt;&lt;\/iron-ajax&gt;\n  &lt;iron-list items=\"[[data]]\" as=\"item\"&gt;\n    &lt;template&gt;\n      &lt;div&gt;\n        Name: [[item.name]]\n      &lt;\/div&gt;\n    &lt;\/template&gt;\n  &lt;\/iron-list&gt;\n&lt;\/template&gt;\n```\n\n### Accessibility\n\n`iron-list` automatically manages the focus state for the items. It also provides\na `tabIndex` property within the template scope that can be used for keyboard navigation.\nFor example, users can press the up and down keys to move to previous and next\nitems in the list:\n\n```html\n&lt;iron-list items=\"[[data]]\" as=\"item\"&gt;\n  &lt;template&gt;\n    &lt;div tabindex$=\"[[tabIndex]]\"&gt;\n      Name: [[item.name]]\n    &lt;\/div&gt;\n  &lt;\/template&gt;\n&lt;\/iron-list&gt;\n```\n\n### Styling\n\nYou can use the `--iron-list-items-container` mixin to style the container of items:\n\n```css\niron-list {\n --iron-list-items-container: {\n    margin: auto;\n  };\n}\n```\n\n### Resizing\n\n`iron-list` lays out the items when it receives a notification via the `iron-resize` event.\nThis event is fired by any element that implements `IronResizableBehavior`.\n\nBy default, elements such as `iron-pages`, `paper-tabs` or `paper-dialog` will trigger\nthis event automatically. If you hide the list manually (e.g. you use `display: none`)\nyou might want to implement `IronResizableBehavior` or fire this event manually right\nafter the list became visible again. For example:\n\n```js\ndocument.querySelector('iron-list').fire('iron-resize');\n```\n\n### When should `&lt;iron-list&gt;` be used?\n\n`iron-list` should be used when a page has significantly more DOM nodes than the ones\nvisible on the screen. e.g. the page has 500 nodes, but only 20 are visible at the time.\nThis is why we refer to it as a `virtual` list. In this case, a `dom-repeat` will still\ncreate 500 nodes which could slow down the web app, but `iron-list` will only create 20.\n\nHowever, having an `iron-list` does not mean that you can load all the data at once.\nSay, you have a million records in the database, you want to split the data into pages\nso you can bring a page at the time. The page could contain 500 items, and iron-list\nwill only render 20.\n\n",

By default it supports\na curved or horizontal transition, but the transition duration and properties\ncan be customized.\n\nExample:\n\n    &lt;iron-swipeable-container&gt;\n      &lt;div&gt;I can be swiped&lt;\/div&gt;\n      &lt;paper-card heading=\"Me too!\"&gt;&lt;\/paper-card&gt;\n    &lt;\/iron-swipeable-container&gt;\n\nTo disable swiping on individual children, you must give them the `.disable-swipe`\nclass. Alternatively, to disable swiping on the whole container, you can use its\n`disable-swipe` attribute:\n\n    &lt;iron-swipeable-container&gt;\n      &lt;div class=\"disable-swipe\"&gt;I cannot be swiped be swiped&lt;\/div&gt;\n      &lt;paper-card heading=\"But I can!\"&gt;&lt;\/paper-card&gt;\n    &lt;\/iron-swipeable-container&gt;\n\n    &lt;iron-swipeable-container disable-swipe&gt;\n      &lt;div&gt;I cannot be swiped&lt;\/div&gt;\n      &lt;paper-card heading=\"Me neither :(\"&gt;&lt;\/paper-card&gt;\n    &lt;\/iron-swipeable-container&gt;\n\nIt is a good idea to disable text selection on any of the children that you\nwant to be swiped:\n\n    .swipe {\n      -moz-user-select: none;\n      -ms-user-select: none;\n      -webkit-user-select: none;\n      user-select: none;\n      cursor: default;\n    }\n\n",

For more information on which attributes are\navailable on the native form element, see https:\/\/developer.mozilla.org\/en-US\/docs\/Web\/HTML\/Element\/form\n\nIt supports both `get` and `post` methods, and uses an `iron-ajax` element to\nsubmit the form data to the action URL.\n\n  Example:\n\n    &lt;form is=\"iron-form\" id=\"form\" method=\"post\" action=\"\/form\/handler\"&gt;\n      &lt;paper-input name=\"name\" label=\"name\"&gt;&lt;\/paper-input&gt;\n      &lt;input name=\"address\"&gt;\n      ...\n    &lt;\/form&gt;\n\nBy default, a native `&lt;button&gt;` element will submit this form. However, if you\nwant to submit it from a custom element's click handler, you need to explicitly\ncall the form's `submit` method.\n\n  Example:\n\n    &lt;paper-button raised onclick=\"submitForm()\"&gt;Submit&lt;\/paper-button&gt;\n\n    function submitForm() {\n      document.getElementById('form').submit();\n    }\n\nTo customize the request sent to the server, you can listen to the `iron-form-presubmit`\nevent, and modify the form's[`iron-ajax`](https:\/\/elements.polymer-project.org\/elements\/iron-ajax)\nobject. However, If you want to not use `iron-ajax` at all, you can cancel the\nevent and do your own custom submission:\n\n  Example of modifying the request, but still using the build-in form submission:\n\n    form.addEventListener('iron-form-presubmit', function() {\n      this.request.method = 'put';\n      this.request.params = someCustomParams;\n    });\n\n  Example of bypassing the build-in form submission:\n\n    form.addEventListener('iron-form-presubmit', function(event) {\n      event.preventDefault();\n      var firebase = new Firebase(form.getAttribute('action'));\n      firebase.set(form.serialize());\n    });\n\n",

If there are multiple occurrences, only one will be active.\n\n# Sample\n\nFor a complete sample that uses the element, see the [Cat Push\nNotifications][3] project.\n\n# Requirements\nPush messaging is currently only available in Google Chrome, which\nrequires you to configure Google Cloud Messaging. Chrome will check that\nyour page links to a manifest file that contains a `gcm_sender_id` field.\nYou can find full details of how to set all of this up in the [HTML5\nRocks guide to push notifications][1].\n\n# Notification details\nThe data for how a notification should be displayed can come from one of\nthree places.\n\nFirstly, you can specify a URL from which to fetch the message data.\n```\n&lt;platinum-push-messaging\n  message-url=\"notification-data.json\"&gt;\n&lt;\/platinum-push-messaging&gt;\n```\n\nThe second way is to send the message data in the body of\nthe push message from your server. In this case you do not need to\nconfigure anything in your page:\n```\n&lt;platinum-push-messaging&gt;&lt;\/platinum-push-messaging&gt;\n```\n**Note that this method is not currently supported by any browser**. It\nis, however, defined in the\n[draft W3C specification](http:\/\/w3c.github.io\/push-api\/#the-push-event)\nand this element should use that data when it is implemented in the\nfuture.\n\nIf a message-url is provided then the message body will be ignored in\nfavor of the first method.\n\nThirdly, you can manually define the attributes on the element:\n```\n&lt;platinum-push-messaging\n  title=\"Application updated\"\n  message=\"The application was updated in the background\"\n  icon-url=\"icon.png\"\n  click-url=\"notification.html\"&gt;\n&lt;\/platinum-push-messaging&gt;\n```\nThese values will also be used as defaults if one of the other methods\ndoes not provide a value for that property.\n\n# Testing\nIf you have set up Google Cloud Messaging then you can send push messages\nto your browser by following the guide in the [GCM documentation][2].\n\nHowever, for quick client testing there are two options. You can use the\n`testPush` method, which allows you to simulate a push message that\nincludes a payload.\n\nOr, at a lower level, you can open up chrome:\/\/serviceworker-internals in\nChrome and use the 'Push' button for the service worker corresponding to\nyour app.\n\n[1]: http:\/\/updates.html5rocks.com\/2015\/03\/push-notificatons-on-the-open-web\n[2]: https:\/\/developer.android.com\/google\/gcm\/http.html\n[3]: https:\/\/github.com\/notwaldorf\/caturday-post\n\n",

The\nheader is initially on the top part of the view but it scrolls away with the\nrest of the scrollable content.  Upon scrolling slightly up at any point, the\nheader scrolls back into view.  This saves screen space and allows users to\naccess important controls by easily moving them back to the view.\n\n__Important:__ The `paper-scroll-header-panel` will not display if its parent does not have a height.\n\nUsing [layout classes](https:\/\/www.polymer-project.org\/1.0\/docs\/migration.html#layout-attributes) or custom properties, you can easily make the `paper-scroll-header-panel` fill the screen\n\n```html\n&lt;body class=\"fullbleed layout vertical\"&gt;\n  &lt;paper-scroll-header-panel class=\"flex\"&gt;\n    &lt;paper-toolbar&gt;\n      &lt;div&gt;Hello World!&lt;\/div&gt;\n    &lt;\/paper-toolbar&gt;\n  &lt;\/paper-scroll-header-panel&gt;\n&lt;\/body&gt;\n```\n\nor, if you would prefer to do it in CSS, just give `html`, `body`, and `paper-scroll-header-panel` a height of 100%:\n\n```css\nhtml, body {\n  height: 100%;\n  margin: 0;\n}\npaper-scroll-header-panel {\n  height: 100%;\n}\n```\n\n`paper-scroll-header-panel` works well with `paper-toolbar` but can use any element\nthat represents a header by adding a `paper-header` class to it.\n\n```html\n&lt;paper-scroll-header-panel&gt;\n  &lt;div class=\"paper-header\"&gt;Header&lt;\/div&gt;\n  &lt;div&gt;Content goes here...&lt;\/div&gt;\n&lt;\/paper-scroll-header-panel&gt;\n```\n\n### Styling\n=======\n\nThe following custom properties and mixins are available for styling:\n\nCustom property | Description | Default\n----------------|-------------|----------\n--paper-scroll-header-panel-full-header | To change background for toolbar when it is at its full size | {}\n--paper-scroll-header-panel-condensed-header | To change the background for toolbar when it is condensed | {}\n--paper-scroll-header-container | To override or add container styles | {}\n\n",

            "description": "\n`iron-a11y-keys` provides a cross-browser interface for processing \nkeyboard commands. The interface adheres to [WAI-ARIA best \npractices](http:\/\/www.w3.org\/TR\/wai-aria-practices\/#kbd_general_binding). \nIt uses an expressive syntax to filter key presses.\n\n## Basic usage\n\nThe sample code below is a portion of a custom element. The goal is to call\nthe `onEnter` method whenever the `paper-input` element is in focus and \nthe `Enter` key is pressed.\n\n    &lt;iron-a11y-keys id=\"a11y\" target=\"[[target]]\" keys=\"enter\"\n                        on-keys-pressed=\"onEnter\"&gt;&lt;\/iron-a11y-keys&gt;\n    &lt;paper-input id=\"input\"\n                 placeholder=\"Type something. Press enter. Check console.\"\n                 value=\"{{userInput::input}}\"&gt;&lt;\/paper-input&gt;\n\nThe custom element declares an `iron-a11y-keys` element that is bound to a \nproperty called `target`. The `target` property\nneeds to evaluate to the `paper-input` node. `iron-a11y-keys` registers \nan event handler for the target node using Polymer's [annotated event handler\nsyntax](https:\/\/www.polymer-project.org\/1.0\/docs\/devguide\/events.html#annotated-listeners). `{{userInput::input}}` sets the `userInput` property to the \nuser's input on each keystroke. \n\nThe last step is to link the two elements within the custom element's \nregistration.\n\n    ...\n    properties: {\n      userInput: {\n        type: String,\n        notify: true,\n      },\n      target: {\n        type: Object,\n        value: function() {\n          return this.$.input;\n        }\n      },\n    },\n    onEnter: function() {\n      console.log(this.userInput);\n    }\n    ...\n\n## The `keys` attribute\n\nThe `keys` attribute expresses what combination of keys triggers the event.\n\nThe attribute accepts a space-separated, plus-sign-concatenated \nset of modifier keys and some common keyboard keys.\n\nThe common keys are: `a-z`, `0-9` (top row and number pad), `*` (shift 8 and \nnumber pad), `F1-F12`, `Page Up`, `Page Down`, `Left Arrow`, `Right Arrow`,\n`Down Arrow`, `Up Arrow`, `Home`, `End`, `Escape`, `Space`, `Tab`, `Enter`.\n\nThe modifier keys are: `Shift`, `Control`, `Alt`.\n\nAll keys are expected to be lowercase and shortened. E.g.\n`Left Arrow` is `left`, `Page Down` is `pagedown`, `Control` is `ctrl`, \n`F1` is `f1`, `Escape` is `esc`, etc.\n\n### Grammar\n\nBelow is the [EBNF](http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Extended_Backus%E2%80%93Naur_Form) \nGrammar of the `keys` attribute.\n\n    modifier = \"shift\" | \"ctrl\" | \"alt\";\n    ascii = ? \/[a-z0-9]\/ ? ;\n    fnkey = ? f1 through f12 ? ;\n    arrow = \"up\" | \"down\" | \"left\" | \"right\" ;\n    key = \"tab\" | \"esc\" | \"space\" | \"*\" | \"pageup\" | \"pagedown\" | \n          \"home\" | \"end\" | arrow | ascii | fnkey;\n    keycombo = { modifier, \"+\" }, key ;\n    keys = keycombo, { \" \", keycombo } ;\n\n### Example\n\nGiven the following value for `keys`: \n\n`ctrl+shift+f7 up pagedown esc space alt+m`\n\nThe event is fired if any of the following key combinations are fired: \n`Control` and `Shift` and `F7` keys, `Up Arrow` key, `Page Down` key, \n`Escape` key, `Space` key, `Alt` and `M` keys.\n\n### WAI-ARIA Slider Example\n\nThe following is an example of the set of keys that fulfills WAI-ARIA's \n\"slider\" role [best\npractices](http:\/\/www.w3.org\/TR\/wai-aria-practices\/#slider):\n\n    &lt;iron-a11y-keys target=\"[[target]]\" keys=\"left pagedown down\" \n                    on-keys-pressed=\"decrement\"&gt;&lt;\/iron-a11y-keys&gt;\n    &lt;iron-a11y-keys target=\"\"[[target]] keys=\"right pageup up\" \n                    on-keys-pressed=\"increment\"&gt;&lt;\/iron-a11y-keys&gt;\n    &lt;iron-a11y-keys target=\"[[target]]\" keys=\"home\" \n                    on-keys-pressed=\"setMin\"&gt;&lt;\/iron-a11y-keys&gt;\n    &lt;iron-a11y-keys target=\"\"[[target]] keys=\"end\" \n                    on-keys-pressed=\"setMax\"&gt;&lt;\/iron-a11y-keys&gt;\n\nThe `target` properties must evaluate to a node. See the basic usage \nexample above.\n\nEach of the values for the `on-keys-pressed` attributes must evalute\nto methods. The `increment` method should move the slider a set amount \ntoward the maximum value. `decrement` should move the slider a set amount \ntoward the minimum value. `setMin` should move the slider to the minimum \nvalue. `setMax` should move the slider to the maximum value.\n\n",

The\neffect can be visualized as a concentric circle with motion.\n\nExample:\n\n    &lt;div style=\"position:relative\"&gt;\n      &lt;paper-ripple&gt;&lt;\/paper-ripple&gt;\n    &lt;\/div&gt;\n\nNote, it's important that the parent container of the ripple be relative position, otherwise\nthe ripple will emanate outside of the desired container.\n\n`paper-ripple` listens to \"mousedown\" and \"mouseup\" events so it would display ripple\neffect when touches on it.  You can also defeat the default behavior and\nmanually route the down and up actions to the ripple element.  Note that it is\nimportant if you call `downAction()` you will have to make sure to call\n`upAction()` so that `paper-ripple` would end the animation loop.\n\nExample:\n\n    &lt;paper-ripple id=\"ripple\" style=\"pointer-events: none;\"&gt;&lt;\/paper-ripple&gt;\n    ...\n    downAction: function(e) {\n      this.$.ripple.downAction({x: e.x, y: e.y});\n    },\n    upAction: function(e) {\n      this.$.ripple.upAction();\n    }\n\nStyling ripple effect:\n\n  Use CSS color property to style the ripple:\n\n    paper-ripple {\n      color: #4285f4;\n    }\n\n  Note that CSS color property is inherited so it is not required to set it on\n  the `paper-ripple` element directly.\n\nBy default, the ripple is centered on the point of contact.  Apply the `recenters`\nattribute to have the ripple grow toward the center of its container.\n\n    &lt;paper-ripple recenters&gt;&lt;\/paper-ripple&gt;\n\nYou can also  center the ripple inside its container from the start.\n\n    &lt;paper-ripple center&gt;&lt;\/paper-ripple&gt;\n\nApply `circle` class to make the rippling effect within a circle.\n\n    &lt;paper-ripple class=\"circle\"&gt;&lt;\/paper-ripple&gt;\n\n",

Modifying them will in turn modify the URL.\n\niron-page-url is only active while it is attached to the document.\n\n#### Links\n\nWhile iron-page-url is active in the document it will intercept clicks on links\nwithin your site, updating the URL pushing the updated URL out through the\ndatabinding system. iron-page-url only intercepts clicks with the intent to\nopen in the same window, so middle mouse clicks and ctrl\/cmd clicks work fine.\n\nYou can customize this behavior with the `urlSpaceRegex`.\n\n#### Dwell Time\n\niron-page-url protects against accidental history spamming by only adding\nentries to the user's history if the URL stays unchanged for `dwellTime`\nmilliseconds.\n\n",

Many APIs also\nneed to be enabled in the Google Developers Console before you can use them.\n\nThe `requestVisibleActions` attribute is necessary if you want to write app\nactivities (https:\/\/developers.google.com\/+\/web\/app-activities\/) on behalf of\nthe user. Please note that this attribute is only valid in combination with the\nplus.login scope (https:\/\/www.googleapis.com\/auth\/plus.login).\n\nThe `offline` attribute allows you to get an auth code which your server can\nredeem for an offline access token\n(https:\/\/developers.google.com\/identity\/sign-in\/web\/server-side-flow).\nYou can also set `offline-always-prompt` instead of `offline` to ensure that your app\nwill re-prompt the user for offline access and generate a working `refresh_token`\neven if they have already granted offline access to your app in the past.\n\nUse label properties to customize prompts.\n\nThe button can be styled in using the `height`, `width`, and `theme` attributes.\nThese attributes help you follow the Google+ Sign-In button branding guidelines\n(https:\/\/developers.google.com\/+\/branding-guidelines).\n\nThe `google-signin-success` event is triggered when a user successfully authenticates\nand `google-signed-out` is triggered when user signs out.\nYou can also use `isAuthorized` attribute to observe user's authentication state.\n\nAdditional events, such as `google-signout-attempted` are\ntriggered when the user attempts to sign-out and successfully signs out.\n\nWhen requesting offline access, the `google-signin-offline-success` event is\ntriggered when the user successfully consents with offline support.\n\nThe `google-signin-necessary` event is fired when scopes requested via\ngoogle-signin-aware elements require additional user permissions.\n\n#### Testing\n\nBy default, the demo accompanying this element is setup to work on localhost with\nport 8080. That said, you *should* update the `clientId` to your own one for\nany apps you're building. See the Google Developers Console\n(https:\/\/console.developers.google.com) for more info.\n\n",

You can use `iron-meta` to share whatever you want (or create an extension\n[like x-meta] for enhancements).\n\nThe `iron-meta` instances containing your actual data can be loaded in an import,\nor constructed in any way you see fit.

The drawer\nand the main panel are side-by-side with drawer on the left.  When the browser\nwindow size is smaller than the `responsiveWidth`, `paper-drawer-panel`\nchanges to narrow layout.  In narrow layout, the drawer will be stacked on top\nof the main panel.  The drawer will slide in\/out to hide\/reveal the main\npanel.\n\nUse the attribute `drawer` to indicate that the element is the drawer panel and\n`main` to indicate that the element is the main panel.\n\nExample:\n\n    &lt;paper-drawer-panel&gt;\n      &lt;div drawer&gt; Drawer panel... &lt;\/div&gt;\n      &lt;div main&gt; Main panel... &lt;\/div&gt;\n    &lt;\/paper-drawer-panel&gt;\n\nThe drawer and the main panels are not scrollable.  You can set CSS overflow\nproperty on the elements to make them scrollable or use `paper-header-panel`.\n\nExample:\n\n    &lt;paper-drawer-panel&gt;\n      &lt;paper-header-panel drawer&gt;\n        &lt;paper-toolbar&gt;&lt;\/paper-toolbar&gt;\n        &lt;div&gt; Drawer content... &lt;\/div&gt;\n      &lt;\/paper-header-panel&gt;\n      &lt;paper-header-panel main&gt;\n        &lt;paper-toolbar&gt;&lt;\/paper-toolbar&gt;\n        &lt;div&gt; Main content... &lt;\/div&gt;\n      &lt;\/paper-header-panel&gt;\n    &lt;\/paper-drawer-panel&gt;\n\nAn element that should toggle the drawer will automatically do so if it's\ngiven the `paper-drawer-toggle` attribute.  Also this element will automatically\nbe hidden in wide layout.\n\nExample:\n\n    &lt;paper-drawer-panel&gt;\n      &lt;paper-header-panel drawer&gt;\n        &lt;paper-toolbar&gt;\n          &lt;div&gt;Application&lt;\/div&gt;\n        &lt;\/paper-toolbar&gt;\n        &lt;div&gt; Drawer content... &lt;\/div&gt;\n      &lt;\/paper-header-panel&gt;\n      &lt;paper-header-panel main&gt;\n        &lt;paper-toolbar&gt;\n          &lt;paper-icon-button icon=\"menu\" paper-drawer-toggle&gt;&lt;\/paper-icon-button&gt;\n          &lt;div&gt;Title&lt;\/div&gt;\n        &lt;\/paper-toolbar&gt;\n        &lt;div&gt; Main content... &lt;\/div&gt;\n      &lt;\/paper-header-panel&gt;\n    &lt;\/paper-drawer-panel&gt;\n\nTo position the drawer to the right, add `right-drawer` attribute.\n\n    &lt;paper-drawer-panel right-drawer&gt;\n      &lt;div drawer&gt; Drawer panel... &lt;\/div&gt;\n      &lt;div main&gt; Main panel... &lt;\/div&gt;\n    &lt;\/paper-drawer-panel&gt;\n\n### Styling\n\nTo change the main container:\n\n    paper-drawer-panel {\n      --paper-drawer-panel-main-container: {\n        background-color: gray;\n      };\n    }\n\nTo change the drawer container when it's in the left side:\n\n    paper-drawer-panel {\n      --paper-drawer-panel-left-drawer-container: {\n        background-color: white;\n      };\n    }\n\nTo change the drawer container when it's in the right side:\n\n    paper-drawer-panel {\n      --paper-drawer-panel-right-drawer-container: {\n        background-color: white;\n      };\n    }\n\nTo customize the scrim:\n\n    paper-drawer-panel {\n      --paper-drawer-panel-scrim: {\n        background-color: red;\n      };\n    }\n\nThe following custom properties and mixins are available for styling:\n\nCustom property | Description | Default\n----------------|-------------|----------\n`--paper-drawer-panel-scrim-opacity` | Scrim opacity | 1\n`--paper-drawer-panel-drawer-container` | Mixin applied to drawer container | {}\n`--paper-drawer-panel-left-drawer-container` | Mixin applied to container when it's in the left side | {}\n`--paper-drawer-panel-main-container` | Mixin applied to main container | {}\n`--paper-drawer-panel-right-drawer-container` | Mixin applied to container when it's in the right side | {}\n`--paper-drawer-panel-scrim` | Mixin applied to scrim | {}\n\n",

You can configure\nthe attribute it listens to with the `attr-for-value` attribute.\n\n### Using a custom input element\n\nYou can use a custom input element in a `&lt;paper-input-container&gt;`, for example to implement a\ncompound input field like a social security number input. The custom input element should have the\n`paper-input-input` class, have a `notify:true` value property and optionally implements\n`Polymer.IronValidatableBehavior` if it is validatable.\n\n    &lt;paper-input-container attr-for-value=\"ssn-value\"&gt;\n      &lt;label&gt;Social security number&lt;\/label&gt;\n      &lt;ssn-input class=\"paper-input-input\"&gt;&lt;\/ssn-input&gt;\n    &lt;\/paper-input-container&gt;\n\n\nIf you're using a `&lt;paper-input-container&gt;` imperatively, it's important to make sure\nthat you attach its children (the `iron-input` and the optional `label`) before you\nattach the `&lt;paper-input-container&gt;` itself, so that it can be set up correctly.\n\n### Validation\n\nIf the `auto-validate` attribute is set, the input container will validate the input and update\nthe container styling when the input value changes.\n\n### Add-ons\n\nAdd-ons are child elements of a `&lt;paper-input-container&gt;` with the `add-on` attribute and\nimplements the `Polymer.PaperInputAddonBehavior` behavior. They are notified when the input value\nor validity changes, and may implement functionality such as error messages or character counters.\nThey appear at the bottom of the input.\n\n### Prefixes and suffixes\nThese are child elements of a `&lt;paper-input-container&gt;` with the `prefix`\nor `suffix` attribute, and are displayed inline with the input, before or after.\n\n    &lt;paper-input-container&gt;\n      &lt;div prefix&gt;$&lt;\/div&gt;\n      &lt;label&gt;Total&lt;\/label&gt;\n      &lt;input is=\"iron-input\"&gt;\n      &lt;paper-icon-button suffix icon=\"clear\"&gt;&lt;\/paper-icon-button&gt;\n    &lt;\/paper-input-container&gt;\n\n### Styling\n\nThe following custom properties and mixins are available for styling:\n\nCustom property | Description | Default\n----------------|-------------|----------\n`--paper-input-container-color` | Label and underline color when the input is not focused | `--secondary-text-color`\n`--paper-input-container-focus-color` | Label and underline color when the input is focused | `--primary-color`\n`--paper-input-container-invalid-color` | Label and underline color when the input is is invalid | `--error-color`\n`--paper-input-container-input-color` | Input foreground color | `--primary-text-color`\n`--paper-input-container` | Mixin applied to the container | `{}`\n`--paper-input-container-disabled` | Mixin applied to the container when it's disabled | `{}`\n`--paper-input-container-label` | Mixin applied to the label | `{}`\n`--paper-input-container-label-focus` | Mixin applied to the label when the input is focused | `{}`\n`--paper-input-container-label-floating` | Mixin applied to the label when floating | `{}`\n`--paper-input-container-input` | Mixin applied to the input | `{}`\n`--paper-input-container-underline` | Mixin applied to the underline | `{}`\n`--paper-input-container-underline-focus` | Mixin applied to the underline when the input is focused | `{}`\n`--paper-input-container-underline-disabled` | Mixin applied to the underline when the input is disabled | `{}`\n`--paper-input-prefix` | Mixin applied to the input prefix | `{}`\n`--paper-input-suffix` | Mixin applied to the input suffix | `{}`\n\nThis element is `display:block` by default, but you can set the `inline` attribute to make it\n`display:inline-block`.\n",

The currently selected\nitem is displayed in the control. If no item is selected, the `label` is\ndisplayed instead.\n\nThe child element with the class `dropdown-content` will be used as the dropdown\nmenu. It could be a `paper-menu` or element that triggers `iron-select` when\nselecting its children.\n\nExample:\n\n    &lt;paper-dropdown-menu label=\"Your favourite pastry\"&gt;\n      &lt;paper-menu class=\"dropdown-content\"&gt;\n        &lt;paper-item&gt;Croissant&lt;\/paper-item&gt;\n        &lt;paper-item&gt;Donut&lt;\/paper-item&gt;\n        &lt;paper-item&gt;Financier&lt;\/paper-item&gt;\n        &lt;paper-item&gt;Madeleine&lt;\/paper-item&gt;\n      &lt;\/paper-menu&gt;\n    &lt;\/paper-dropdown-menu&gt;\n\nThis example renders a dropdown menu with 4 options.\n\nSimilarly to using `iron-select`, `iron-deselect` events will cause the\ncurrent selection of the `paper-dropdown-menu` to be cleared.\n\n### Styling\n\nThe following custom properties and mixins are also available for styling:\n\nCustom property | Description | Default\n----------------|-------------|----------\n`--paper-dropdown-menu` | A mixin that is applied to the element host | `{}`\n`--paper-dropdown-menu-disabled` | A mixin that is applied to the element host when disabled | `{}`\n`--paper-dropdown-menu-ripple` | A mixin that is applied to the internal ripple | `{}`\n`--paper-dropdown-menu-button` | A mixin that is applied to the internal menu button | `{}`\n`--paper-dropdown-menu-input` | A mixin that is applied to the internal paper input | `{}`\n`--paper-dropdown-menu-icon` | A mixin that is applied to the internal icon | `{}`\n\nYou can also use any of the `paper-input-container` and `paper-menu-button`\nstyle mixins and custom properties to style the internal input and menu button\nrespectively.\n\n",

This can come in handy when the configuration (e.g. which files to precache)\ndepends on the results of a build script.\n\nIf configuration for the same properties are provided in both the JSON file and via the\nelement's attributes, then in general the JSON file's values take precedence. The one\nexception is the `precache` property. Any values in the element's `precache` attribute will\nbe concatenated with the values in the JSON file's `precache` property and the set of files\nthat are precached will be the union of the two.\n\nThere's one additional option, `precacheFingerprint`, that can be set in the JSON. If using\na build script that might output a large number of files to precache, its recommended\nthat your build script generate a unique \"fingerprint\" of the files. Any changes to the\n`precacheFingerprint` value will result in the underlying service worker kicking off the\nprocess of caching the files listed in `precache`.\nWhile there are a few different strategies for generating an appropriate\n`precacheFingerprint` value, a process that makes sense is to use a stable hash of the\nserialized `precache` array. That way, any changes to the list of files in `precache`\nwill result in a new `precacheFingerprint` value.\nIf your build script is Node.js based, one way to generate this hash is:\n\n    var md5 = require('crypto').createHash('md5');\n    md5.update(JSON.stringify(precache));\n    var precacheFingerprint = md5.digest('hex');\n\nAlternatively, you could use something like the\n[SHA-1 signature](http:\/\/stackoverflow.com\/questions\/1161869\/how-to-get-sha-of-the-latest-commit-from-remote-git-repository)\nof your latest `git` commit for the `precacheFingerprint` value.\n\nAn example file may look like:\n\n    {\n      \"cacheId\": \"my-cache-id\",\n      \"defaultCacheStrategy\": \"fastest\",\n      \"disabled\": false,\n      \"precache\": [\"file1.html\", \"file2.css\"],\n      \"precacheFingerprint\": \"FINGERPRINT_OF_FILES_IN_PRECACHE\"\n    }\n       ",

            "description": "\nMaterial design: [Buttons](https:\/\/www.google.com\/design\/spec\/components\/buttons.html)\n\n`paper-button` is a button. When the user touches the button, a ripple effect emanates\nfrom the point of contact. It may be flat or raised. A raised button is styled with a\nshadow.\n\nExample:\n\n    &lt;paper-button&gt;Flat button&lt;\/paper-button&gt;\n    &lt;paper-button raised&gt;Raised button&lt;\/paper-button&gt;\n    &lt;paper-button noink&gt;No ripple effect&lt;\/paper-button&gt;\n    &lt;paper-button toggles&gt;Toggle-able button&lt;\/paper-button&gt;\n\nA button that has `toggles` true will remain `active` after being clicked (and\nwill have an `active` attribute set). For more information, see the `Polymer.IronButtonState`\nbehavior.\n\nYou may use custom DOM in the button body to create a variety of buttons. For example, to\ncreate a button with an icon and some text:\n\n    &lt;paper-button&gt;\n      &lt;iron-icon icon=\"favorite\"&gt;&lt;\/iron-icon&gt;\n      custom button content\n    &lt;\/paper-button&gt;\n\n### Styling\n\nStyle the button with CSS as you would a normal DOM element.\n\n    paper-button.fancy {\n      background: green;\n      color: yellow;\n    }\n\n    paper-button.fancy:hover {\n      background: lime;\n    }\n\n    paper-button[disabled],\n    paper-button[toggles][active] {\n      background: red;\n    }\n\nBy default, the ripple is the same color as the foreground at 25% opacity. You may\ncustomize the color using the `--paper-button-ink-color` custom property.\n\nThe following custom properties and mixins are also available for styling:\n\nCustom property | Description | Default\n----------------|-------------|----------\n`--paper-button-ink-color` | Background color of the ripple | `Based on the button's color`\n`--paper-button` | Mixin applied to the button | `{}`\n`--paper-button-disabled` | Mixin applied to the disabled button. Note that you can also use the `paper-button[disabled]` selector | `{}`\n`--paper-button-flat-keyboard-focus` | Mixin applied to a flat button after it's been focused using the keyboard | `{}`\n`--paper-button-raised-keyboard-focus` | Mixin applied to a raised button after it's been focused using the keyboard | `{}`\n\n",

Possible use cases include:\n\n- Using a special caching strategy for specific URLs.\n- Returning static \"fallback\" responses instead of network errors when a remote API\nis unavailable.\n\nIn short, any scenario in which you'd like a service worker to intercept network\nrequests and provide custom response handling.\n\nIf you'd like a single caching policy applied to all same-origin requests, then an alternative\nto using `&lt;platinum-sw-fetch&gt;` is to use `&lt;platinum-sw-cache&gt;` with the `defaultCacheStategy`\nproperty set.\n\nUnder the hood, the [sw-toolbox](https:\/\/github.com\/googlechrome\/sw-toolbox) library is used\nfor all the request handling logic.\n\n`&lt;platinum-sw-fetch&gt;` needs to be a child element of `&lt;platinum-sw-register&gt;`.\n\nAn example configuration is:\n\n    &lt;platinum-sw-register auto-register&gt;\n      &lt;platinum-sw-import-script href=\"custom-fetch-handler.js\"&gt;&lt;\/platinum-sw-import-script&gt;\n      &lt;platinum-sw-fetch handler=\"customFetchHandler\"\n                         path=\"\/(.*)\/customFetch\"&gt;&lt;\/platinum-sw-fetch&gt;\n    &lt;\/platinum-sw-register&gt;\n\nThis implies that there's a `custom-fetch-handler.js` file in the same directory as the current\npage, which defines a `sw-toolbox` compliant\n[request handler](https:\/\/github.com\/googlechrome\/sw-toolbox#request-handlers) named\n`customFetchHandler`. This definition is imported using `&lt;platinum-sw-import-script&gt;`. The\n`&lt;platinum-sw-fetch&gt;` element takes care of mapping which request paths are handled by\n`customFetchHandler`.\n\nAnything not matching the `path` pattern is ignored by `&lt;platinum-sw-fetch&gt;`,\nand it's possible to have multiple `&lt;platinum-sw-fetch&gt;` elements that each define different\npaths and different handlers. The path matching is performed top-down, starting with the first\n`&lt;platinum-sw-fetch&gt;` element.\n\nThe `path` will, by default, only match same-origin requests. If you'd like to define a custom\nhandler for requests on a specific cross-origin domain, you must use the `origin` parameter\nin conjunction with `path` to match the domains you'd like to handle.\n   ",

In this case, care should be taken that only one scrollable\nregion with the same orientation as this element is contained within. Alternatively,\nthe `scrollTarget` property can be set\/bound to a non-child scrollable region, from which\nit will listen for events.\n\nOnce a threshold has been reached, a `lower-threshold` or `upper-threshold` event will\nbe fired, at which point the user may perform actions such as lazily-loading more data\nto be displayed. After any work is done, the user must then clear the threshold by\ncalling the `clearTriggers` method on this element, after which it will\nbegin listening again for the scroll position to reach the threshold again assuming\nthe content in the scrollable region has grown. If the user no longer wishes to receive\nevents (e.g. all data has been exhausted), the threshold property in question (e.g.\n`lowerThreshold`) may be set to a falsy value to disable events and clear the associated\ntriggered property.\n\n### Example\n\n```html\n&lt;iron-scroll-threshold on-lower-threshold=\"loadMoreData\"&gt;\n  &lt;div&gt;content&lt;\/div&gt;\n&lt;\/iron-scroll-threshold&gt;\n```\n\n```js\n  loadMoreData: function() {\n    \/\/ load async stuff. e.g. XHR\n    asyncStuff(function done() {\n      ironScrollTheshold.clearTriggers();\n    });\n  }\n```\n\n### Using dom-repeat\n\n```html\n&lt;iron-scroll-threshold on-lower-threshold=\"loadMoreData\"&gt;\n  &lt;dom-repeat items=\"[[items]]\"&gt;\n    &lt;template&gt;\n      &lt;div&gt;[[index]]&lt;\/div&gt;\n    &lt;\/template&gt;\n  &lt;\/dom-repeat&gt;\n&lt;\/iron-scroll-threshold&gt;\n```\n\n### Using iron-list\n\n```html\n&lt;iron-scroll-threshold on-lower-threshold=\"loadMoreData\" id=\"threshold\"&gt;\n  &lt;iron-list scroll-target=\"threshold\" items=\"[[items]]\"&gt;\n    &lt;template&gt;\n      &lt;div&gt;[[index]]&lt;\/div&gt;\n    &lt;\/template&gt;\n  &lt;\/iron-list&gt;\n&lt;\/iron-scroll-threshold&gt;\n```\n\n",

[Layout classes](https:\/\/github.com\/PolymerElements\/iron-flex-layout\/tree\/master\/iron-flex-layout-classes.html).\nThe layout class stylesheet provides a simple set of class-based flexbox rules, that\nlet you specify layout properties directly in markup. You must include this file\nin every element that needs to use them.\n\n  Sample use:\n\n      &lt;link rel=\"import\" href=\"..\/iron-flex-layout\/iron-flex-layout-classes.html\"&gt;\n      &lt;style is=\"custom-style\" include=\"iron-flex iron-flex-alignment\"&gt;&lt;\/style&gt;\n\n      &lt;div class=\"layout horizontal layout-start\"&gt;\n        &lt;div&gt;cross axis start alignment&lt;\/div&gt;\n      &lt;\/div&gt;\n\n2. [Custom CSS mixins](https:\/\/github.com\/PolymerElements\/iron-flex-layout\/blob\/master\/iron-flex-layout.html).\nThe mixin stylesheet includes custom CSS mixins that can be applied inside a CSS rule using the `@apply` function.\n\nPlease note that the old [\/deep\/ layout classes](https:\/\/github.com\/PolymerElements\/iron-flex-layout\/tree\/master\/classes)\nare deprecated, and should not be used. To continue using layout properties\ndirectly in markup, please switch to using the new `dom-module`-based\n[layout classes](https:\/\/github.com\/PolymerElements\/iron-flex-layout\/tree\/master\/iron-flex-layout-classes.html).\nPlease note that the new version does not use `\/deep\/`, and therefore requires you\nto import the `dom-modules` in every element that needs to use them.\n\nA complete [guide](https:\/\/elements.polymer-project.org\/guides\/flex-layout) to `&lt;iron-flex-layout&gt;` is available.\n\n"

For example, if you want to select item by\n  `name`, set `attrForSelected` to `name`.\n\n  Example:\n\n      &lt;iron-selector attr-for-selected=\"name\" selected=\"foo\"&gt;\n        &lt;div name=\"foo\"&gt;Foo&lt;\/div&gt;\n        &lt;div name=\"bar\"&gt;Bar&lt;\/div&gt;\n        &lt;div name=\"zot\"&gt;Zot&lt;\/div&gt;\n      &lt;\/iron-selector&gt;\n\n  `iron-selector` is not styled. Use the `iron-selected` CSS class to style the selected element.\n\n  Example:\n\n      &lt;style&gt;\n        .iron-selected {\n          background: #eee;\n        }\n      &lt;\/style&gt;\n\n      ...\n\n      &lt;iron-selector selected=\"0\"&gt;\n        &lt;div&gt;Item 1&lt;\/div&gt;\n        &lt;div&gt;Item 2&lt;\/div&gt;\n        &lt;div&gt;Item 3&lt;\/div&gt;\n      &lt;\/iron-selector&gt;\n\n  ",

If you are using the icons\nprovided by `iron-icons`, they will inherit the foreground color of the button.\n\n    \/* make a red \"favorite\" button *\/\n    &lt;paper-icon-button icon=\"favorite\" style=\"color: red;\"&gt;&lt;\/paper-icon-button&gt;\n\nBy default, the ripple is the same color as the foreground at 25% opacity. You may\ncustomize the color using the `--paper-icon-button-ink-color` custom property.\n\nThe following custom properties and mixins are available for styling:\n\nCustom property | Description | Default\n----------------|-------------|----------\n`--paper-icon-button-disabled-text` | The color of the disabled button | `--disabled-text-color`\n`--paper-icon-button-ink-color` | Selected\/focus ripple color | `--primary-text-color`\n`--paper-icon-button` | Mixin for a button | `{}`\n`--paper-icon-button-disabled` | Mixin for a disabled button | `{}`\n`--paper-icon-button-hover` | Mixin for button on hover | `{}`\n\n",

It is currently only partially implemented\nin Chrome OS 45 and Chrome 49 for Android behind the experimental flag\n`chrome:\/\/flags\/#enable-web-bluetooth`.\n\n`&lt;platinum-bluetooth-characteristic&gt;` needs to be a child of a\n`&lt;platinum-bluetooth-service&gt;` element.\n\nFor instance, here's how to read battery level from a nearby bluetooth\ndevice advertising Battery service:\n\n```html\n&lt;platinum-bluetooth-device services-filter='[\"battery_service\"]'&gt;\n  &lt;platinum-bluetooth-service service='battery_service'&gt;\n    &lt;platinum-bluetooth-characteristic characteristic='battery_level'&gt;\n    &lt;\/platinum-bluetooth-characteristic&gt;\n  &lt;\/platinum-bluetooth-service&gt;\n&lt;\/platinum-bluetooth-device&gt;\n```\n```js\nvar bluetoothDevice = document.querySelector('platinum-bluetooth-device');\nvar batteryLevel = document.querySelector('platinum-bluetooth-characteristic');\n\nbutton.addEventListener('click', function() {\n  bluetoothDevice.request().then(function() {\n    return batteryLevel.read().then(function(value) {\n      console.log('Battery Level is ' + value.getUint8(0) + '%');\n    });\n  })\n  .catch(function(error) { });\n});\n```\n\nHere's another example on how to reset energy expended on nearby\nbluetooth device advertising Heart Rate service:\n\n```html\n&lt;platinum-bluetooth-device services-filter='[\"heart_rate\"]'&gt;\n  &lt;platinum-bluetooth-service service='heart_rate'&gt;\n    &lt;platinum-bluetooth-characteristic characteristic='heart_rate_control_point'&gt;\n    &lt;\/platinum-bluetooth-characteristic&gt;\n  &lt;\/platinum-bluetooth-service&gt;\n&lt;\/platinum-bluetooth-device&gt;\n```\n```js\nvar bluetoothDevice = document.querySelector('platinum-bluetooth-device');\nvar heartRateCtrlPoint = document.querySelector('platinum-bluetooth-characteristic');\n\nbutton.addEventListener('click', function() {\n  bluetoothDevice.request().then(function() {\n    \/\/ Writing 1 is the signal to reset energy expended.\n    var resetEnergyExpended = new Uint8Array([1]);\n    return heartRateCtrlPoint.write(resetEnergyExpended).then(function() {\n      console.log('Energy expended has been reset');\n    });\n  })\n  .catch(function(error) { });\n});\n```\n\nIt is also possible for `&lt;platinum-bluetooth-characteristic&gt;` to fill in\na data-bound field in response to a read.\n\n```html\n&lt;platinum-bluetooth-device services-filter='[\"heart_rate\"]'&gt;\n  &lt;platinum-bluetooth-service service='heart_rate'&gt;\n    &lt;platinum-bluetooth-characteristic characteristic='body_sensor_location'\n                                       value={{bodySensorLocation}}&gt;\n    &lt;\/platinum-bluetooth-characteristic&gt;\n  &lt;\/platinum-bluetooth-service&gt;\n&lt;\/platinum-bluetooth-device&gt;\n...\n&lt;span&gt;{{bodySensorLocation}}&lt;\/span&gt;\n```\n```js\nvar bluetoothDevice = document.querySelector('platinum-bluetooth-device');\nvar bodySensorLocation = document.querySelector('platinum-bluetooth-characteristic');\n\nbutton.addEventListener('click', function() {\n  bluetoothDevice.request().then(function() {\n    return bodySensorLocation.read()\n  })\n  .catch(function(error) { });\n});\n```\n\nStarting and stopping notifications on a `&lt;platinum-bluetooth-characteristic&gt;` is pretty straightforward when taking advantage of the [Polymer Change notification protocol](https:\/\/www.polymer-project.org\/1.0\/docs\/devguide\/data-binding.html#change-notification-protocol). Here's how to get your Heart Rate Measurement for instance:\n\n```html\n&lt;platinum-bluetooth-device services-filter='[\"heart_rate\"]'&gt;\n  &lt;platinum-bluetooth-service service='heart_rate'&gt;\n    &lt;platinum-bluetooth-characteristic characteristic='heart_rate_measurement'\n                                       on-value-changed='parseHeartRate'&gt;\n    &lt;\/platinum-bluetooth-characteristic&gt;\n  &lt;\/platinum-bluetooth-service&gt;\n&lt;\/platinum-bluetooth-device&gt;\n```\n```js\nvar bluetoothDevice = document.querySelector('platinum-bluetooth-device');\nvar heartRate = document.querySelector('platinum-bluetooth-characteristic');\n\nstartButton.addEventListener('click', function() {\n  bluetoothDevice.request().then(function() {\n    return heartRate.startNotifications().catch(function(error) { });\n  });\n});\n\nstopButton.addEventListener('click', function() {\n  heartRate.stopNotifications().catch(function(error) { });\n});\n\nfunction parseHeartRate(event) {\n let value = event.target.value;\n \/\/ Do something with the DataView Object value...\n}\n```\n\nYou can also use changes in `value` to drive characteristic writes when\n`auto-write` property is set to true.\n\n```html\n&lt;platinum-bluetooth-device services-filter='[\"heart_rate\"]'&gt;\n  &lt;platinum-bluetooth-service service='heart_rate'&gt;\n    &lt;platinum-bluetooth-characteristic characteristic='heart_rate_control_point'\n                                              auto-write&gt;\n    &lt;\/platinum-bluetooth-characteristic&gt;\n  &lt;\/platinum-bluetooth-service&gt;\n&lt;\/platinum-bluetooth-device&gt;\n```\n```js\nvar bluetoothDevice = document.querySelector('platinum-bluetooth-device');\nvar heartRateCtrlPoint = document.querySelector('platinum-bluetooth-characteristic');\n\nbutton.addEventListener('click', function() {\n  bluetoothDevice.request().then(function() {\n    \/\/ Writing 1 is the signal to reset energy expended.\n    heartRateCtrlPoint.value = new Uint8Array([1]);\n  })\n  .catch(function(error) { });\n});\n\nheartRateCtrlPoint.addEventListener('platinum-bluetooth-auto-write-error',\n    function(event) {\n  \/\/ Handle error...\n});\n```\n\n[1]: https:\/\/developers.google.com\/web\/updates\/2015\/07\/interact-with-ble-devices-on-the-web\n[2]: https:\/\/github.com\/WebBluetoothCG\/web-bluetooth\n\n",

I could define more\nattributes or use child nodes to define additional metadata.\n\nNow I can access that element (and it's metadata) from any iron-meta instance\nvia the byKey method, e.g.\n\n    meta.byKey('info').getAttribute('value');\n\nPure imperative form would be like:\n\n    document.createElement('iron-meta').byKey('info').getAttribute('value');\n\nOr, in a Polymer element, you can include a meta in your template:\n\n    &lt;iron-meta id=\"meta\"&gt;&lt;\/iron-meta&gt;\n    ...\n    this.$.meta.byKey('info').getAttribute('value');\n\n",

            "description": "\nMaterial design: [Toolbars](https:\/\/www.google.com\/design\/spec\/components\/toolbars.html)\n\n`paper-toolbar` is a horizontal bar containing items that can be used for\nlabel, navigation, search and actions.  The items placed inside the\n`paper-toolbar` are projected into a `class=\"horizontal center layout\"` container inside of\n`paper-toolbar`'s Shadow DOM.  You can use flex attributes to control the items'\nsizing.\n\nExample:\n\n```html\n&lt;paper-toolbar&gt;\n  &lt;paper-icon-button icon=\"menu\" on-tap=\"menuAction\"&gt;&lt;\/paper-icon-button&gt;\n  &lt;div class=\"title\"&gt;Title&lt;\/div&gt;\n  &lt;paper-icon-button icon=\"more-vert\" on-tap=\"moreAction\"&gt;&lt;\/paper-icon-button&gt;\n&lt;\/paper-toolbar&gt;\n```\n\n`paper-toolbar` has a standard height, but can made be taller by setting `tall`\nclass on the `paper-toolbar`. This will make the toolbar 3x the normal height.\n\n```html\n&lt;paper-toolbar class=\"tall\"&gt;\n  &lt;paper-icon-button icon=\"menu\"&gt;&lt;\/paper-icon-button&gt;\n&lt;\/paper-toolbar&gt;\n```\n\nApply `medium-tall` class to make the toolbar medium tall.  This will make the\ntoolbar 2x the normal height.\n\n```html\n&lt;paper-toolbar class=\"medium-tall\"&gt;\n  &lt;paper-icon-button icon=\"menu\"&gt;&lt;\/paper-icon-button&gt;\n&lt;\/paper-toolbar&gt;\n```\n\nWhen `tall`, items can pin to either the top (default), middle or bottom.  Use\n`middle` class for middle content and `bottom` class for bottom content.\n\n```html\n&lt;paper-toolbar class=\"tall\"&gt;\n  &lt;paper-icon-button icon=\"menu\"&gt;&lt;\/paper-icon-button&gt;\n  &lt;div class=\"middle title\"&gt;Middle Title&lt;\/div&gt;\n  &lt;div class=\"bottom title\"&gt;Bottom Title&lt;\/div&gt;\n&lt;\/paper-toolbar&gt;\n```\n\nFor `medium-tall` toolbar, the middle and bottom contents overlap and are\npinned to the bottom.  But `middleJustify` and `bottomJustify` attributes are\nstill honored separately.\n\nTo make an element completely fit at the bottom of the toolbar, use `fit` along\nwith `bottom`.\n\n```html\n&lt;paper-toolbar class=\"tall\"&gt;\n  &lt;div id=\"progressBar\" class=\"bottom fit\"&gt;&lt;\/div&gt;\n&lt;\/paper-toolbar&gt;\n```\n\nWhen inside a `paper-header-panel` element, the class `.animate` is toggled to animate\nthe height change in the toolbar.\n\n### Styling\n\nThe following custom properties and mixins are available for styling:\n\nCustom property | Description | Default\n----------------|-------------|----------\n`--paper-toolbar-title`      | Mixin applied to the title of the toolbar | `{}`\n`--paper-toolbar-background` | Toolbar background color     | `--primary-color`\n`--paper-toolbar-color`      | Toolbar foreground color     | `--dark-theme-text-color`\n`--paper-toolbar-height`     | Custom height for toolbar    | `64px`\n`--paper-toolbar-sm-height`  | Custom height for small screen toolbar | `56px`\n`--paper-toolbar`            | Mixin applied to the toolbar | `{}`\n`--paper-toolbar-content`    | Mixin applied to the content section of the toolbar | `{}`\n`--paper-toolbar-medium`     | Mixin applied to medium height toolbar | `{}`\n`--paper-toolbar-tall`       | Mixin applied to tall height toolbar | `{}`\n`--paper-toolbar-transition` | Transition applied to the `.animate` class | `height 0.18s ease-in`\n\n### Accessibility\n\n`&lt;paper-toolbar&gt;` has `role=\"toolbar\"` by default. Any elements with the class `title` will\nbe used as the label of the toolbar via `aria-labelledby`.\n\n",

            "description": "\n`carbon-route` is an element that enables declarative, self-describing routing\nfor a web app.\n\n&gt; *n.b. carbon-route is still in beta. We expect it will need some changes. We're counting on your feedback!*\n\nIn its typical usage, a `carbon-route` element consumes an object that describes\nsome state about the current route, via the `route` property. It then parses\nthat state using the `pattern` property, and produces two artifacts: some `data`\nrelated to the `route`, and a `tail` that contains the rest of the `route` that\ndid not match.\n\nHere is a basic example, when used with `carbon-location`:\n\n    &lt;carbon-location route=\"{{route}}\"&gt;&lt;\/carbon-location&gt;\n    &lt;carbon-route\n        route=\"{{route}}\"\n        pattern=\"\/:page\"\n        data=\"{{data}}\"\n        tail=\"{{tail}}\"&gt;\n    &lt;\/carbon-route&gt;\n\nIn the above example, the `carbon-location` produces a `route` value. Then, the\n`route.path` property is matched by comparing it to the `pattern` property. If\nthe `pattern` property matches `route.path`, the `carbon-route` will set or update\nits `data` property with an object whose properties correspond to the parameters\nin `pattern`. So, in the above example, if `route.path` was `'\/about'`, the value\nof `data` would be `{\"page\": \"about\"}`.\n\nThe `tail` property represents the remaining part of the route state after the\n`pattern` has been applied to a matching `route`.\n\nHere is another example, where `tail` is used:\n\n    &lt;carbon-location route=\"{{route}}\"&gt;&lt;\/carbon-location&gt;\n    &lt;carbon-route\n        route=\"{{route}}\"\n        pattern=\"\/:page\"\n        data=\"{{routeData}}\"\n        tail=\"{{subroute}}\"&gt;\n    &lt;\/carbon-route&gt;\n    &lt;carbon-route\n        route=\"{{subroute}}\"\n        pattern=\"\/:id\"\n        data=\"{{subrouteData}}\"&gt;\n    &lt;\/carbon-route&gt;\n\nIn the above example, there are two `carbon-route` elements. The first\n`carbon-route` consumes a `route`. When the `route` is matched, the first\n`carbon-route` also produces `routeData` from its `data`, and `subroute` from\nits `tail`. The second `carbon-route` consumes the `subroute`, and when it\nmatches, it produces an object called `subrouteData` from its `tail`.\n\nSo, when `route.path` is `'\/about'`, the `routeData` object will look like\nthis: `{ page: 'about' }`\n\nAnd `subrouteData` will be null. However, if `route.path` changes to\n`'\/article\/123'`, the `routeData` object will look like this:\n`{ page: 'article' }`\n\nAnd the `subrouteData` will look like this: `{ id: '123' }`\n\n`carbon-route` is responsive to bi-directional changes to the `data` objects\nthey produce. So, if `routeData.page` changed from `'article'` to `'about'`,\nthe `carbon-route` will update `route.path`. This in-turn will update the\n`carbon-location`, and cause the global location bar to change its value.\n\n",

They give users a quick sense of how much longer an operation\nwill take.\n\nExample:\n\n    &lt;paper-progress value=\"10\"&gt;&lt;\/paper-progress&gt;\n\nThere is also a secondary progress which is useful for displaying intermediate\nprogress, such as the buffer level during a streaming playback progress bar.\n\nExample:\n\n    &lt;paper-progress value=\"10\" secondary-progress=\"30\"&gt;&lt;\/paper-progress&gt;\n\n### Styling progress bar:\n\nTo change the active progress bar color:\n\n    paper-progress {\n       --paper-progress-active-color: #e91e63;\n    }\n\nTo change the secondary progress bar color:\n\n    paper-progress {\n      --paper-progress-secondary-color: #f8bbd0;\n    }\n\nTo change the progress bar background color:\n\n    paper-progress {\n      --paper-progress-container-color: #64ffda;\n    }\n\nAdd the class `transiting` to a paper-progress to animate the progress bar when\nthe value changed.
